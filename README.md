### Cats vs. Dogs Image Classification

This project is focused on building a machine learning model to classify images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project walks through several stages of the machine learning pipeline, including data preparation, model building, training, and evaluation. The goal is to develop a robust model capable of accurately distinguishing between images of cats and dogs.

#### Objectives

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Load and preprocess the dataset consisting of 10,000 labeled images of cats and dogs. The dataset is divided into two classes (cats and dogs) and further split into training and validation sets. Dataset link is given below:

2. **Model Design and Implementation**: Construct a CNN architecture using TensorFlow and Keras, including layers for convolution, pooling, and fully connected (dense) layers.

3. **Training the Model**: Train the model on the training dataset while monitoring its performance on the validation dataset. The goal is to minimize the loss and maximize accuracy.

4. **Model Optimization**: Apply techniques such as data augmentation and dropout to reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalization to new, unseen data.

5. **Evaluation and Visualization**: Analyze the model's performance by visualizing the accuracy and loss curves, and finally, use the trained model to predict the class of new images.

#### Detailed Steps

1. **Dataset Creation**:
   - **Loading Data**: The dataset is organized into two sub-directories: one for cat images and another for dog images. We utilize TensorFlow's `image_dataset_from_directory` function to load the images into training and validation datasets with a standard image size of 180x180 pixels.
   - **Splitting Data**: The data is split into 80% training and 20% validation to ensure the model is evaluated on unseen data during training.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - **Visualizing Data**: The project includes a step to visualize the first few images from the dataset to understand the data distribution and verify that images are correctly labeled.

3. **Model Building**:
   - **Sequential Model**: A Keras Sequential model is built, consisting of three convolutional blocks, each followed by a max-pooling layer to downsample the feature maps. The model ends with a fully connected layer to output predictions.
   - **Compiling the Model**: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss. Accuracy is used as the metric for model evaluation.

4. **Training the Model**:
   - **Model Training**: The model is trained for 10 epochs, with the accuracy and loss monitored for both training and validation datasets. The initial results indicate that the model may suffer from overfitting, as evidenced by the discrepancy between training and validation accuracy.

5. **Addressing Overfitting**:
   - **Data Augmentation**: To reduce overfitting, data augmentation is applied. This technique generates additional training samples by randomly transforming the existing data (e.g., flipping, rotating, and zooming images).
   - **Dropout Regularization**: A dropout layer is added to the model to randomly deactivate a fraction of neurons during training, further reducing the risk of overfitting.

6. **Model Retraining**:
   - **Extended Training**: The model is retrained for 15 epochs with the data augmentation and dropout layers included. This helps improve the model's ability to generalize to new data, as evidenced by more balanced accuracy between training and validation datasets.

7. **Evaluation and Results**:
   - **Performance Visualization**: The training process is visualized by plotting the accuracy and loss for both training and validation sets across epochs. These plots provide insight into how well the model is learning and whether it is still overfitting.
   - **Prediction on New Data**: The final trained model is used to predict the class of new images (e.g., images of cats and dogs not seen during training), demonstrating the model's practical application.

#### Key Learnings

- **Convolutional Neural Networks**: Understanding the role of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers in processing image data.
- **Overfitting and Generalization**: Learning how data augmentation and dropout can help combat overfitting, thereby improving the model's generalization to unseen data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Gaining experience in monitoring model performance and understanding the importance of validation during training.

#### Future Work

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimenting with different architectures, learning rates, and batch sizes to further optimize model performance.
- **Transfer Learning**: Implementing transfer learning with pre-trained models such as VGG16 or ResNet to potentially improve accuracy with less training time.
- **Deployment**: Packaging the trained model into a web or mobile application for real-time image classification.
